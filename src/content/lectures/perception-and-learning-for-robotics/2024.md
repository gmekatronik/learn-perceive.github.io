title: Lab - Perception and Learning for Robotics
lecture: plr
summary: "MSc course with short research projects solving robot perception problems with deep learning"
---

In this course, you will work on small research projects in teams of 2. As course introduction, we will discuss the most relevant papers together in the group.

In the final session of the course, all project outcomes will be presented in a poster session.

## Lecture Dates

The lecture will be mixed between virtual and in-person meetings. In-person meetings take place in the computer science building (Friedrich-Hirzebruch-Allee 8).

## Possible Projects

Students can either choose from proposed projects in the first lecture or may propose their own projects if they fit into the course context.

As an example for course projects, the available projects are:

- building-scale scene graph creation and language queries from rgbd ([paper to present](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss20/p077.pdf))
- detection and affordance prediction of functional elements ([paper to present](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Delitzas_SceneFun3D_Fine-Grained_Functionality_and_Affordance_Understanding_in_3D_Scenes_CVPR_2024_paper.html))
- stereo depth completion for meta aria glasses ([paper to present](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123580120.pdf))
