[Stretch](https://hello-robot.com/stretch-3-product) is a robot platform for easy mobile manipulation in homes. In this project, we want to port the mobile manipulation stack that we already built for [spot-compose](https://spot-compose.github.io) to stretch. Final goal is a demo of a robot that can be queried by natural language to fetch differnet objects.
