Motivation: Building "dynamic Scene Graphs" that allow to add to the already acquired static information of the scene data that can be learned from observations based on the users interactions How: 'Mine' the knowledge from egocentric observations (e.g. aria glasses, HoloLens). Potentially, action recognition, and tracking, etc. Will be helpful to process these observations. Then build a static scene graph with the information of the environment. Some information is stored explicitly but all the information should be ‘queryable by language’ such that we can answer
