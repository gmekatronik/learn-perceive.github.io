title: Continual Test-Time-Optimization for Vision Foundation Models
visible: true
---
Robots have access to large amounts of data that they can collect from their deployment environments. We want to tap into this resource to optimize foundation models such as DINO to work optimally in these deployment environments, and to leverage the scale of long-term deployment to improve them for downstream applications such as object identification and tracking.

## Requirements
Experience with pytorch and python
