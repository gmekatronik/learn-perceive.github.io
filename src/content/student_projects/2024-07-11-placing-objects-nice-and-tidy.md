In this project, we build upon [spot-compose](https://spot-compose.github.io/) and investigate the problem of placing objects into drawers, shelfs, and other furniture. This requires to already plan when grasping the object how the robot hand will need to move to place the object in the required pose into the furniture. It also requires to avoid collision with the furniture while placing the object.

When it comes to deciding how to place an object (e.g. a bottle), there are usually poses that are considered "correct" by humans. E.g., you would want to place a bottle upright and not on the side, even if it is much easier for the robot to place it on the side. Such "common sense" knowledge is what tools like GPT excel at. We therefore want to extract the correct object pose from GPT and interface this with the developed grasp-planner to tidy up objects and arrange them nicely in a shelf.
